# To install Ansible, you need:
# A machine with Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 or higher installed. This includes Red Hat, Debian, CentOS, macOS, and BSDs.
# The latest stable version of a package manager, such as yum.
# Ansible version 2.14 or later.
# 4 GB of memory.
# 20 GB of dedicated hard disk space.
# A currently supported version of Mozilla FireFox or Google Chrome.
# Ansible can run on any machine with Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 or higher installed. However, Windows is not supported for the control node. Ansible can run on Windows under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) distribution. However, WSL is not supported by Ansible and should not be used for production systems.
# Ansible recommends 4 GB of memory per 100 forks. For example, if forks is set to 100, 4 GB of memory is recommended. If forks is set to 400, 16 GB of memory is recommended.
# Ansible uses a simple language, YAML, to define playbooks. Ansible doesn't require the installation of any extra agents on the managed nodes.
